# Clarification prompts for different error scenarios
zero_results_clarification: |
  I couldn't find any data matching your query: "{original_query}"

  This might be because:
  â€¢ The customer ID doesn't exist in our database
  â€¢ The date range specified has no records
  â€¢ The status or filter criteria don't match any loans

  Could you please:
  1. Verify the customer ID is correct
  2. Check if you meant a different date range
  3. Confirm the loan status you're looking for (active, closed, etc.)

  Available loan statuses: Active, Closed, Pending

validation_failed_clarification: |
  I had trouble understanding your query: "{original_query}"

  Could you please rephrase it more specifically? For example:
  â€¢ "Show me loan details for customer 1900"
  â€¢ "What is the current EMI for loan ID 2001?"
  â€¢ "List all active loans"
  â€¢ "Show payment history for customer 1900"

sql_error_clarification: |
  I encountered an issue processing your query: "{original_query}"

  Please try:

  â€¢ "What is my current loan amount?" (if customer ID is known)
  â€¢ "Show details for loan 2001"
  â€¢ "List all loans for customer 1900"
